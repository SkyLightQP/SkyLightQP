I try not to prioritize technology over the problem itself, and sometimes that means Yak Shaving and reinvent the wheel.

You can check out my [**Résumé**](https://daegyeo.me?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=github_readme/) to see what I've done so far, the projects I've worked on. You can read about my development stories and hobbies on [**Blog**](https://blog.skylightqp.kr?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=github_readme/).
I also do algorithmic problem-solving on [**Baekjoon**](https://www.acmicpc.net/user/combbm/). I also have a [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daegyeom).

Briefly, I've contributed to these places:

- Diary service for encrypted contents of diary entries, **[Maru](https://maruu.space)**
- Web-based dice boardgame: **[Marble](https://github.com/SkyLightQP/marble/)**
- HighSchool Intranet: check the timetable and register for the course **[Sinamon (수정과)](https://github.com/swjb-sinamon/)**
